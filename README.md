The project involves a real estate platform where sellers can log in and upload their lands, but only after getting their Family Registration Certificate (FRC) verified through blockchain technology. The platform stores the hash of the FRC file on the blockchain, and when a seller uploads their FRC, the system calculates the hash of the uploaded file and matches it with the stored hash to verify its authenticity. Once verified, sellers can upload their lands, view a gallery of their uploaded lands, and see requests from buyers. Buyers can add their information, search for lands based on their required square yards, and send requests to sellers. Sellers can then accept or reject these requests. The platform aims to digitalize the land registration process, ensuring security and efficiency through blockchain verification.
